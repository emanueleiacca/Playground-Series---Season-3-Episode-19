# Kaggle Playground Competition: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
This repository contains the code and solutions for the Kaggle Playground Competition on Time Series Analysis and Forecasting. The competition was a part of Kaggle's Playground Series, designed to provide participants with lightweight challenges to enhance their skills in machine learning and data science.

# Competition Overview
Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! The goal of this competition is to explore time series data, perform analysis, and develop accurate forecasts for the number of units sold. The dataset is synthetically generated from real-world data and focuses on various features related to product sales.

# Code Overview

## Data Exploration and Visualization

The provided code demonstrates initial data exploration and visualization techniques using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels.
The code loads the training data, checks for missing values, and generates various visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships.

## Time Series Analysis

The code preprocesses the date-related features and performs time-based transformations to capture patterns and seasonality in the data.
It uses seasonal decomposition, autocorrelation, and partial autocorrelation plots to analyze the time series data.

## Machine Learning Modeling

The code showcases the use of a Random Forest Regressor model for forecasting.
It creates time-based features from the date and uses them along with other relevant features to train the model.
The trained model is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.

## Making Predictions and Submission

The code preprocesses the test data similarly to the training data and uses the trained Random Forest model to make predictions for the test set.
The predicted values are plotted against the dates to visualize the forecast.
The code also reads the sample submission file, replaces the 'num_sold' column with the predicted values, and saves the updated submission to a new CSV file.
